# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A 'Study Guide' for what we're supposed to have learned before the start of the bootcamp. 
Note: I appreciate the 'Note', but I genuinely wouldn't have done 95% of this if it wasn't an assignment - I'm already somewhat familiar with HTML, CSS, Git, and JS.
